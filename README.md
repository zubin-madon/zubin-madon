### Zubin Madon's Github Profile

## Hi there üëã
After drilling oil & gas wells for 14 years, I gave up command of my last offshore oil rig in Feb 2021 and have been coding all day everyday since. I had learnt HTML, C, C++ as part of my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering so I was familiar with the basics. In 2021 I started with Python, then moved on to JS, Solidity, React and NextJS.

### Portfolio Highlights with key Repos a Short Summary for Each:

## üî≠ Stuff I've Built:
### Web3/ React/ Next JS/ Solidity:

1. [Geckos AI](https://github.com/zubin-madon/GeckosAI) - A derivative art NFT project created using neural network transfer of Sci-Fi scenes on the Gallactic Geckos (using Python). Using Candy Machine and Metaplex to setup the mint on Solana. With a front-end minting Dapp. *URL: https://geckosAI.online*

2. [The Spot NFTs](https://github.com/zubin-madon/spot-nft-dapp) - I'm really proud of this React Dapp I built for **The Spot NFT project on Avalanche**.

3. [Token Trees](https://tokentreesNFT.com) - A Python Dapp that generates a tree out of all the ERC721 tokens in your wallet, that you can mint. The trees come in thousands of variations of size, shape and colour combinations. Contract: [NFTrees.sol](https://github.com/zubin-madon/NFTrees/blob/main/contracts/trees_final.sol)

4. [SofSafe](https://github.com/zubin-madon/sofsafe), [Echigo](https://github.com/zubin-madon/echigo), [Neural Apes Yacht Club](https://github.com/zubin-madon/nayc), [Proof Of Rug](https://github.com/zubin-madon/ProofOfRug) are a few of many React/ Next JS sites, NFT dapps I have built. 
*URLs:(nayc.online, proofofrug.in, echigo.tech)*

5. You will find some Solidity smart contracts scattered in between: [Echigo.sol](https://gist.github.com/zubin-madon/1148e2934956e59bf7c98504f0dac6ea) is a meme reflector token contract with a buy/sell tax of 4%. This token is deployed on the Echelon EVM chain.

### Python Web & Desktop Apps, (plus algos to perform mundane tasks like mass image editing):
1. [Ton-Miles Calculator](https://github.com/zubin-madon/Ton-Miles-Manager-for-Oil-Rigs) - A desktop app built in Python Tkinter for the daily calculation of ton-miles accumulated on the drilling line.

2. [Potty Punks](https://github.com/zubin-madon/PottyPunksNFT) - Python Pillow algos to modify, mix and match hundreds of different traits to create 10,000 derivatives of crypto punks sitting on pottys. This repo will help you take photoshop layers of any NFT art concept you have and manipulate colours, superimpose layers to create finished pfps, etc.

3. [Wallet Tracker Bot](https://github.com/zubin-madon/Wallet-Tracker-Bot) - A discord bot that gives real time transaction alerts on a list of whale wallets. If the said wallets transact on Ethereum, Avalanche or Fantom chains, the bot will immediately send an alert in the Discord Channel, with a link to the txn details.

4. [Ethereum Block Updater](https://github.com/zubin-madon/Ethereum-Block-Updater) - A Python Flask app that shows details & pending transactions on the last 3 Ethereum blocks mined.

## üî≠ Stuff I'm Currently Working On:
- A crypto [wallet-tracker and analysis Dapp](https://github.com/zubin-madon/degenalysis) in Next JS, which will use a combination of web3.js and Moralis.
- [Bogoshipo](https://bogoshipo.com) A Blockchain Pet Game that is a mix of Tamagotchi and Cryptokitties. Work in progress.
- [OD Labs Landing Page](https://od-labs.netlify.app) A website entirely built out of mp4 video clips.
