### Zubin Madon's Github Profile

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
After drilling oil & gas wells for 14 years, I gave up command of my last offshore oil rig in Feb 2021 and have been coding all day everyday since. I had learnt HTML, C, C++ as part of my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering so I was familiar with the basics. In 2021 I started with Python, then moved on to JS, Solidity, React and NextJS.

### Portfolio Highlights with key repos a short summary for each down below:

### ðŸ”­ Stuff I've Built:
### - Web3/ React/ Next JS/ Solidity:

1. [Geckos AI](https://github.com/zubin-madon/GeckosAI) - A derivative art NFT project created using neural network transfer of Sci-Fi scenes on the Gallactic Geckos (using Python). Using Candy Machine and Metaplex to setup the mint on Solana. With a front-end minting Dapp. *URL: https://geckosAI.online*

2. [The Spot NFTs](https://github.com/zubin-madon/spot-nft-dapp) - I'm really proud of this React Dapp I built for **The Spot NFT project on Avalanche**. Users can build their own pfp on a React Canvas using the traits they own. The Dapp has a Metamask login. Users can mix and match over several hundred traits to create a unique pfp. The dapp fetches the traits present in a user's wallet dynamically using Moralis, and allows the user to mint a PFP only if all the chosen traits are available in user's wallet. The Dapp also calls the smart contract on the blockchain to verify if the selected sequence of traits is unique, thus ensuring no 2 PFPs minted will ever look alike.

3. [SofSafe](https://github.com/zubin-madon/sofsafe), [Echigo](https://github.com/zubin-madon/echigo), [Neural Apes Yacht Club](https://github.com/zubin-madon/nayc), [Proof Of Rug](https://github.com/zubin-madon/ProofOfRug) are a few of many React/ Next JS sites, NFT dapps I have built. 
*URLs:(nayc.online, proofofrug.in, echigo.tech)*

4. You will find some Solidity smart contracts scattered in between: [Echigo.sol](https://gist.github.com/zubin-madon/1148e2934956e59bf7c98504f0dac6ea) is a meme reflector token contract with a buy/sell tax of 4%. This token is deployed on the Echelon EVM chain. [NFTrees.sol](https://github.com/zubin-madon/NFTrees/blob/main/contracts/trees_final.sol) is my own ETH NFT project that I am working on. The mint function takes a tokenURI so that each tree that is generated in real time by my Python algo is first uploaded to IPFS via Moralis, and then the IPFS metadata is passed into the mint function.

### - Python Web & Desktop Apps, (plus algos to perform mundane tasks like mass image editing):
1. [Ton-Miles Calculator](https://github.com/zubin-madon/Ton-Miles-Manager-for-Oil-Rigs) - A desktop app built in Python Tkinter for the daily calculation of ton-miles accumulated on the drilling line. It is extremely critical to accurately calculate the wear accumulated on the wire rope, with dozens of different parameters involved, because 100's of tons of steel go in and out of the hole at very high speeds and personnel work directly underneath the contraption 24 hours a day. And then slip/cut a section of the line accordingly every few days. If the line snaps the outcome is catastrophic. In my 14 years I did not come across ANY application that is user friendly and has safeguards for human error. 99% of supervisors in the oilfield still use an excel sheet to perform this daily critical task, and then manually enter the results of the calculation in a spreadsheet. My app incorporates all the various parameters involved in daily drilling/tripping operations and has built-in unit conversions which avoid human error that occurs by doing these conversions manually. It auto-saves the day's result in a CSV file.

2. [Potty Punks](https://github.com/zubin-madon/PottyPunksNFT) - Python Pillow algos to modify, mix and match hundreds of different traits to create 10,000 derivatives of crypto punks sitting on pottys. This repo will help you take photoshop layers of any NFT art concept you have and manipulate colours, superimpose layers to create finished pfps, etc.

3. [Wallet Tracker Bot](https://github.com/zubin-madon/Wallet-Tracker-Bot) - A discord bot that gives real time transaction alerts on a list of whale wallets. If the said wallets transact on Ethereum, Avalanche or Fantom chains, the bot will immediately send an alert in the Discord Channel, with a link to the txn details.

4. [Ethereum Block Updater](https://github.com/zubin-madon/Ethereum-Block-Updater) - A Python Flask app that shows details & pending transactions on the last 3 Ethereum blocks mined.

### ðŸ”­ Stuff I'm Currently Working On:
- A crypto [wallet-tracker and analysis Dapp](https://github.com/zubin-madon/degenalysis) in Next JS, which will use a combination of web3.js and Moralis.
- [NFTrees](https://github.com/zubin-madon/NFTrees) - A Python NFT Project which builds beautiful generative trees of various shapes and colours out of all the ERC-721 tokens in a user's wallet. The front-end dapp will be in FastAPI, using Moralis to connect the dapp to the smart contract.
(ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with fetching the SVG generated on the front-end in order to pass it in a Moralis function and send it to IPFS).
